# Password Protector

A secure way to store passwords on your Android, IOS or Windows device. It uses built-in protections such as PIN, password, face recognition, fingerprint sanner or whatever you have put on your device as a form of security method to unlock the device. The app also provides custom password and/or PIN which can be different from the device's. This means that a maximum of three layers of protection can keep your private information safe!
